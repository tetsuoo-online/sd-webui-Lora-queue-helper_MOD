Hi, this is Tetsuoo.

Thanks to Claude AI, here are somes changes compared to the original script :

- removed the root directory selected by default

- added customizable text to display the lora name for each image on the grid. By default it will use "myfont.ttf" placed in the 'scripts' folder along with this script, otherwise you could use any relative or absolute path to the font of your choice. For some reason, in Forge webui you will have to enter "myfont.ttf" manually otherwise you will get some default tiny pixel font that you can't customize x)
There's no such issue with A1111.
You can use hex color code or keywords like red, white, black etc

- added a checkbox to activate the text or not (on by default)


It *could* be nice to have optional centered text instad of left corner, but I like it the way it is. In any case if you want more options do just like me : Ask your favorite AI how to do it, I'm no Python coder xD
